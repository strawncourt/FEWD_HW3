Additional Comments:

- Great job! You're really getting the hang of this. Good attention to detail in terms of spacing, sizes, and colors. Your HTML is well formatted and your css class & ID names are consistant and descriptive.

- Your a:hover pseudo class style isn't working because later in your CSS you have a rule for ".more-link a" that overrides it with the color #033048. The ".more-link" class provides the same level of specificity as the :hover pseudo class, and since it comes later in the CSS it wins out. Try entering "a:hover" and ".more-link a" into the CSS Specificity Calculator to see what I mean (https://specificity.keegan.st/). To solve this problem you should put your <a> pseudo class styles AFTER other <a> styles.
